# Urgent_stack_project
This program is a simple stack-based task manager. It lets the user add tasks (push), remove the most recent task (pop), view the top task, and display all tasks. The stack follows a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) structure, and the program includes basic input validation and a menu-driven interface.
